# PowerPulseAI
PowerPulseAI is an advanced software solution, leveraging artificial intelligence to forecast energy and heat demand over short and long periods. This is achieved through the employment of a different neural networks and machine learning models, with a systematic comparison to identify the most effective approach. 
The project incorporates seven AI models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN-LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGBoost, and Random Forest Regression models.
Here in this repository you can open the models and review the performance of each model
